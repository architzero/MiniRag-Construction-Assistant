# Mini RAG Project – Construction Marketplace Assistant

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built as part of an assignment.

## Current Status
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Semantic embeddings using sentence-transformers
- FAISS-based vector search (cosine similarity)
- Grounded answer generation with a local LLM (Ollama)
- Assignment index built and stored locally

## Next Steps
- Build frontend interface
- Add evaluation module
- Final polish and documentation
